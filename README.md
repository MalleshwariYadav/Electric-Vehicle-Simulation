# Electric-Vehicle-Simulation

This project simulates the performance and control of an electric vehicle (EV) using MATLAB Simulink. The primary goal is to model the key components of an EV system, including the motor, battery, power electronics, and vehicle dynamics, to analyze speed, torque, and energy consumption under different driving conditions.
The simulation includes a longitudinal driver model to generate acceleration and braking commands, a motor drive system using PWM control, and the vehicle dynamics block to represent the EV’s response to inputs. Key parameters such as speed, torque, and battery power are monitored throughout the simulation to evaluate efficiency and performance. The model also incorporates control logic for acceleration, braking, and energy flow management.
This simulation allows users to visualize how an electric vehicle behaves under various driving scenarios, including different loads, gradients, and driving profiles. It provides insights into energy management strategies, motor performance, and overall vehicle efficiency, making it a useful tool for research and academic learning in EV technology. The project was implemented entirely in MATLAB Simulink, leveraging built-in blocks for motor modeling, power electronics, and system dynamics. The results can be analyzed using scope and output blocks to study the vehicle’s performance metrics.
